## wonkystuff update

I thought that this might be fun as a micro module, so that's what will be in this fork. Let's see what happens!

* __2024/12/30__: Captured schematic and ordered (surface mount) PCBs.
  No changes apart from a buffered output and the use of a standard ICSP header pattern (so we will be able to program the ATTiny85 using something like the USBAsp programmer, readily available online)
* __2024/12/30__: Added Gerber files and renders of the PCB top & bottom for reference. Still no idea whether my changes are good, so hold off on ordering this yourself at the moment!!
