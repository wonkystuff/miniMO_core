## wonkystuff updates

wonkystuff already has an ATTiny85-based programmable module with four knobs and two outputs, so I thought that this simpler module might be fun as a _micro module_ for the __AE Modular__ system, so that's what will be in this fork.

Let's see what happens!

* __2024/12/30__: Added Gerber files and renders of the PCB top & bottom for reference.
    Still no idea whether my changes are good, so hold off on ordering this yourself at the moment!!
* __2024/12/29__: Captured schematic and ordered (surface mount) PCBs.
    No changes apart from a buffered output and the use of a standard ICSP header pattern (so we will be able to program the ATTiny85 using something like the USBAsp programmer, readily available online)
